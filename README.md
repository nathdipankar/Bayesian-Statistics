# Bayesian Statistics
Bayesian statistics has been recently gaining a lot of traction. From applications in machine learning to cyber security to fundamental science Bayesian statistics is coming back in action.

I am learning Bayesian statistics from this wonderful book called Doing Bayesian Analysis by John K. Kruschke. The examples in this book are done in R. However being more comfortable in Python, I am trying to learn from this book and code the examples in Python.

The <a href="https://github.com/nathdipankar/Bayesian-Statistics/tree/master/BinomialProbailityWithExactmathematicalAnalysis" target="_blank">first chapter</a> is about situations where an exact mathematical analysis is possible. This section will talk about Bernoulli´s distribution and it´s conjugate prior the Beta distribution function.

The second chapter will deal with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to deal with situations where we have a large parameter space and no functional form of prior distrbution.
