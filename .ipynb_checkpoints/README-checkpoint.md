# Bayesian Statistics
Bayesian statistics has been recently gaining a lot of traction. From applications in machine learning to cyber security to fundamental science Bayesian statistics is coming back in action.

I am learning Bayesian statistics from this wonderful book called Doing Bayesian Analysis by John K. Kruschke. The examples in this book are done in R. However being more comfortable in Python, I am trying to learn from this book and code the examples in Python.

The <a href="https://github.com/nathdipankar/Bayesian-Statistics/tree/master/BinomialProbailityWithExactmathematicalAnalysis" target="_blank">first chapter</a> is about situations where an exact mathematical analysis is possible.
